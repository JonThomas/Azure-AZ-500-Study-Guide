* Can use the [Check access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/check-access) functionality that is available on each object (resource, group, subscription and management group) in Azure to find out who has permissions to the object
* [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-permissions) can also be used to interpret permissions
