# Manage Azure AD directory groups

* Allows resource owner to set permissions to all members of the group.
* A group is a security boundary
* Groups can be configured to define membership based on rules (job title; department; ...): "Dynamic group membership". 
* Group owners can manage their own groups, allowing for distributed ownership: Self service group management.
* Security groups can have licenses (for example Office licenses) assigned to them, which gives members access to the applications: "Automatic licensing"
