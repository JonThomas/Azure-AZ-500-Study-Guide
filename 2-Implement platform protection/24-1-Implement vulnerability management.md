# Implement vulnerability management

## Container security recommendations

* Use a private container registry (like [Azure Container Registry](23-Configure%20authentication%20for%20Azure%20Container%20Registry.md))
* Monitor and scan container images
   * A Qualys scanner is integrated into Azure Container Registry, and automatically scans all Linux images
* Protect credentials
* Enforce network segmentation on running containers
* .. and a lot of other pretty obvius things like keeping containers updated; regularily scanning for vulnerabilities; least privileges in production; monitoring activity
