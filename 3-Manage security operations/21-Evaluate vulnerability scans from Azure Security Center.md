# Evaluate vulnerability scans from Azure Security Center

[Security alerts and incidents in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-alerts-overview)

## Security alerts and incidents

* Security alerts are generated by Security Center for deployed resources 
* Related alerts are collected into Security Incidents ("Cloud smart alert correlation"), to provide a single view of an attack campaign
* Alerts are classified into severity: High, Medium, Low, Information
* Email alerts are sent out every 6 hours for High-serverity alerts, every 12 hours for Medium-severity alerts and every 24 hours for Low-severity alerts: [Configure email notifications for security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details)

## Vulnerability assessment of VMs, using Qualys (Security Center recommendation)

[Azure Defender's integrated vulnerability assessment solution for Azure and hybrid machines](21-Evaluate%20vulnerability%20scans%20from%20Azure%20Security%20Center.md)

* Vulnerability assessment Can be enabled on Azure VMs and ARC enabled hybrid machines
* Free scan (powered by Qualys) or "Bring your own license" solutions
* Scans can be triggered on demand from the machine itself

## Evaluate vulnerability scans

[View and remediate findings from vulnerability assessment solutions on your VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/remediate-vulnerability-findings-vm)

* Vulnerabilities show up as recommendations in Security Center.
* Remediation steps, links to relevant CVE's (where available) and reference information are included
